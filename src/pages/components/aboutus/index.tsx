                LocumLux is a leading dental locum staffing company that specialises in matching dental professionals with dental practices demand. Our
                sister company Lux Dent Agency was founded in 2017 and the experienced staffs have brainstormed that idea since 2018, however, 2 –
                IT companies took away our monies without completing the project.
                We didn't give up and we came back with even better ideas and latest technologies to accomplish that project.
